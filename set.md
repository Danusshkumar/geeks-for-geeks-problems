The set interface in Java is a collection that contains no duplicate elements. It models the mathematical concept of a set, which allows operations such as union, intersection, and difference. To use the set interface, you need to import the java.util package and implement one of its subclasses, such as HashSet, LinkedHashSet, or TreeSet. Here is an example of how to initialize and use a set in Java:

```java
// Import the java.util package
import java.util.*;

// Create a HashSet object
Set<String> fruits = new HashSet<String>();

// Add elements to the set
fruits.add("Apple");
fruits.add("Banana");
fruits.add("Orange");
fruits.add("Mango");

// Print the set
System.out.println(fruits); // [Apple, Banana, Orange, Mango]

// Check if the set contains an element
System.out.println(fruits.contains("Apple")); // true
System.out.println(fruits.contains("Grapes")); // false

// Remove an element from the set
fruits.remove("Banana");
System.out.println(fruits); // [Apple, Orange, Mango]

// Get the size of the set
System.out.println(fruits.size()); // 3

// Iterate over the set using a for-each loop
for (String fruit : fruits) {
  System.out.println(fruit);
}
/*
Apple
Orange
Mango
*/
```

Some of the features of the set interface in Java are:

- It does not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add an element that already exists in the set, it will be ignored.
- It does not guarantee any order of the elements. The elements may be stored in any random order depending on the implementation. If you want to maintain the insertion order, you can use LinkedHashSet. If you want to sort the elements in natural order, you can use TreeSet.
- It extends the Collection interface and inherits all its methods. Some of the common methods are add(), remove(), contains(), isEmpty(), size(), clear(), and toArray().
- It also provides some specific methods for performing set operations, such as addAll(), retainAll(), and removeAll(). These methods take another collection as a parameter and modify the current set accordingly. For example, addAll() performs the union operation, retainAll() performs the intersection operation, and removeAll() performs the difference operation.
- It is a generic interface, which means you can specify the type of elements it can hold using angle brackets. For example, Set<String> means a set of strings, Set<Integer> means a set of integers, and so on.
